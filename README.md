Devlog: 
November 23, 2023 - 3 Hours - I planned a schedule, researched/referenced games and art, thought of ideas for potential games then chose an idea that I liked from those games, and organized documents/links I will need to use.

November 26/27 - 5 Hours - I set up Github and Unity, wrote in the Project Design Document, created placeholder sketches of all art needed then imported them into Unity, Added an arrow that points to the player's cursor, Made the player move and camera follow the player, changed my project from "Unity 3D" to "Unity 2D"

November 28/29, 2023 - 4 Hours - Player can now shoot two different bullets that return to the player after time, the bullets then get destroyed once they reach the player, limited player to the map, debated more Game Design ideas/Mechanics to add to the game such as a UI system / What the player would be protecting / How long the game will last / Mechanics for a final boss

November 30/December 1, 2023 - 5+ hours - Made Enemies Spawn(came across multiple bugs with the location of their spawn and where they move but fixed them), Added new Art Assets (such as the tree), made enemies move towards the tree, made enemies get destroyed once they reach the tree, enemies get destroyed once they collide with a bullet (came across a bug where enemies do not get destroyed, but fixed it after some time)

December 3, 2023 - Less than 1 hour - Made the bullet flip when returning to the player

December 5, 2023 - 4 hours - Imported tree's health art, Coded the tree's health system, added the tree's health to the UI System (lose a leaf once the tree takes damage), made the Cat Bullet destroy the Cat Monster, made the Dragon bullet destroy the Dragon monster, Made the monsters damage the tree on collision

December 6, 2023 - 3/4 hours - Designed a title/lose/win screen, Added and implemented the title screen/lose screen/win screen to appear in the game when certain events occur, Added a timer, reduced the tree's health bar

December 7, 2023 - 4 hours - Finished monster and bullet art, imported monster and bullet art, Fixed an issue where the monsters would spawn when the player is in a different scene, playtested

December 8, 2023 - 1/2 hours - Playtested, Made then Added new UI art for the timer, Changed "tree's health" UI art, Made then Added new tree art (dead tree and a tree with fruit), Disabled the "controls" screen (wasn't finished with the art), Fixed background image scale (looked right on my screen, but became much smaller when I built the game)
