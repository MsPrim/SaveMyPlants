Devlog: 
November 23, 2023 - Three Hours - I planned a schedule, researched/referenced games and art, thought of ideas for potential games then chose an idea that I liked from those games, and organized documents/links I will need to use.
November 26/27 - Five Hours - I set up Github and Unity, wrote in the Project Design Document, created placeholder sketches of all art needed then imported them into Unity, Added an arrow that points to the player's cursor, Made the player move and camera follow the player, changed my project from "Unity 3D" to "Unity 2D"
November 28/29, 2023 - Four Hours - Player can now shoot two different bullets that return to the player after time, the bullets then get destroyed once they reach the player, limited player to the map, debated more Game Design ideas/Mechanics to add to the game such as a UI system / What the player would be protecting / How long the game will last / Mechanics for a final boss
November 30/December 1, 2023 - 5 hours -
