Devlog: 
November 23, 2023 - 4 Hours - I planned a schedule, researched/referenced games and art, thought of ideas for potential games then chose an idea that I liked from those games, and organized documents/links I will need to use.

November 27/December 1 - 5 Hours - I set up Github and Unity, wrote in the Project Design Document, created placeholder sketches of all art needed then imported them into Unity, Added an arrow that points to the player's cursor, Made the player move and camera follow the player, changed my project from "Unity 3D" to "Unity 2D"

December 2, 2023 - 4 Hours - Player can now shoot two different bullets that return to the player after time, the bullets then get destroyed once they reach the player, limited player to the map, debated more Game Design ideas/Mechanics to add to the game such as a UI system / What the player would be protecting / How long the game will last / Mechanics for a final boss

December 4, 2023 - 5+ hours - Made Enemies Spawn(came across multiple bugs with the location of their spawn and where they move but fixed them), Added new Art Assets (such as the tree), made enemies move towards the tree, made enemies get destroyed once they reach the tree, enemies get destroyed once they collide with a bullet (came across a bug where enemies do not get destroyed, but fixed it after some time)

December 6, 2023 - Less than 1 hour - Made the bullet flip when returning to the player

December 8, 2023 - 4 hours - Imported tree's health art, Coded the tree's health system, added the tree's health to the UI System (lose a leaf once the tree takes damage), made the Cat Bullet destroy the Cat Monster, made the Dragon bullet destroy the Dragon monster, Made the monsters damage the tree on collision

December 9, 2023 - 4 hours - Designed a title/lose/win screen, Added and implemented the title screen/lose screen/win screen to appear in the game when certain events occur, Added a timer, reduced the tree's health bar

December 10, 2023 - 4 hours - Finished monster and bullet art, imported monster and bullet art, Fixed an issue where the monsters would spawn when the player is in a different scene, playtested

December 11, 2023 - 2 hours - Playtested, Made then Added new UI art for the timer, Changed "tree's health" UI art, Made then Added new tree art (dead tree and a tree with fruit), Disabled the "controls" screen (wasn't finished with the art), Fixed background image scale (looked right on my screen, but became much smaller when I built the game)

December 15, 2023 - 2 hours - Wrote an accurate devlog (from activities and hours I kept track of in a google doc and Github) and posted it on Github.

December 16, 2023 - 3 hours - Considered all playtesting. Made and added a control screen to the menu. Reduced the tree's health. Added a rigid body so players can no longer go through the tree. Made UI bigger. Attempted to stop players from shooting the Dragon and Cat bullet at the same time, but couldn't get it to work properly. 

December 18, 2023 - 4 hours - Playtested. Fixed the dimensions of the background images to be much bigger. Made and then implemented an up/down/left/right walk animation. Added audio to all of the scenes and the Dragon/Cat bullets. Found a good pixel Google front, imported the font into Unity and used the font on the UI. 

December 19, 2023 - 3 hours - Playtested. Beta release of the game on itch.io. Decorated the itch.io page with art, text, and screenshots. Made plans for potential updates and marketing.
